# Title (REGEX Tutorial)
Regular expressions (regex) are powerful tools used for pattern matching in strings. They are commonly used in search engines, text processing, and data validation. This tutorial will guide you through the basics of regex and provide examples to help you understand how to use them effectively.

## Summary

In this tutorial, we will cover various components of regex including anchors, quantifiers, OR operators, character classes, flags, grouping and capturing, bracket expressions, greedy and lazy matches, boundaries, back-references, and look-ahead and look-behind assertions. Here is a simple regex example that matches an email address:

```regex
^[a-zA-Z0-9._%+-]+@[a-zA-Z0-9.-]+\.[a-zA-Z]{2,}$
```

## Regex Components

### Anchors
Anchors are used to match positions within a string. The two main anchors are `^` (start of a string) and `$` (end of a string).

### Quantifiers
Quantifiers specify how many instances of a character, group, or character class must be present in the input for a match to be found. Examples include `*`, `+`, `?`, and `{n,m}`.

### OR Operator
The OR operator `|` allows for matching one pattern or another. For example, `cat|dog` matches either "cat" or "dog".

### Character Classes
Character classes match any one of a set of characters. They are defined using square brackets `[]`. For example, `[a-z]` matches any lowercase letter.

### Flags
Flags are used to modify the behavior of the regex. Common flags include `i` for case-insensitive matching and `g` for global matching.

### Grouping and Capturing
Parentheses `()` are used for grouping and capturing parts of the regex. For example, `(abc)` captures the string "abc".

### Bracket Expressions
Bracket expressions are used to specify a set of characters to match. For example, `[abc]` matches any one of the characters "a", "b", or "c".

### Greedy and Lazy Match
Greedy matches try to match as much of the string as possible, while lazy matches try to match as little as possible. Greedy quantifiers include `*` and `+`, while lazy quantifiers include `*?` and `+?`.

### Boundaries
Boundaries are used to match positions between characters. The `\b` boundary matches a word boundary, while `\B` matches a non-word boundary.

### Back-references
Back-references allow you to reuse part of the regex match in the same regex. They are defined using `\1`, `\2`, etc.

### Look-ahead and Look-behind
Look-ahead and look-behind assertions allow you to match a pattern only if it is followed or preceded by another pattern. Look-ahead is defined using `(?=...)`, and look-behind is defined using `(?<=...)`.
